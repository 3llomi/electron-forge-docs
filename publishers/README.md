# Publishers

Publishers are Electron Forge's way of taking the artifacts generated by the `make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or use as updates. This could be your update server or just an S3 bucket.

Each publisher has to be configured in the `publishers` section of your forge configuration with which platforms to run for and the publisher specific config. E.g.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="forge.config.js" %}
```javascript
module.exports = {
  publishers: [
    {
      name: '@electron-forge/publisher-s3'
      platforms: ['darwin', 'linux']
      config: {
        bucket: 'my-bucket',
        folder: 'my/key/prefix'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Please note that all publishers default to publishing all platforms, so you only need to specify the `platforms` key if you don't want that default.
