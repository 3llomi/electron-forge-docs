# Electron Compile

{% hint style="warning" %}
This plugin is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release, it was created as part of Forge@6 to make the migration from `electron-forge@5` easier.  If you are using this plugin you should look into dropping it in favour of vanilla JS or the [Webpack Plugin](webpack.md).
